### Contributors

Many talented instructors contributed to the Intensive curriculum over the years. This node curriculum is based on the version by [Stephanie Andrews](https://github.com/gitsteph). She in turn would like to acknowledge the contributions of [Rachel Waterhouse](https://github.com/rose-water) and [Mark Hellar](https://github.com/mhellar), the two node instructors before her who helped define the content covered in this section.
